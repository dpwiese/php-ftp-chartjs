# PHP FTP ChartJS

This repo contains source code for a small project: create quasi-realtime charts on a Wordpress site from data periodically uploaded to an FTP server.
The most convenient approach would have been connecting to the FTP server from the browser to access, parse, and plot the data.
This would've created issues doing this securely without exposing the FTP credentials, and would have created performance limitations if there was a lot of data that needed to be parsed.
Furthermore, it seems browsers are dropping support for FTP anyway as described in the Chrome Platform Status [Feature: Deprecate FTP support (deprecated)](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6246151319715840) page, on the Bugzilla ticket [Remove FTP support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1574475), as well as in the Mozilla Blog [What to expect for the upcoming deprecation of FTP in Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/04/13/what-to-expect-for-the-upcoming-deprecation-of-ftp-in-firefox/).
Now, browsers like Safari 14 and Chrome 87 both launch the built-in file manager when attempting to access an FTP server.
It seems [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) used to be a potential option, as described in the [2014 documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20141205110759/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest):

> Despite its name, `XMLHttpRequest` can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML, and it supports protocols other than HTTP (including file and ftp).

However, that is no longer the case. Basically, all this meant that if the FTP needed to be accessed, it needed to be done server-side.

This was a more sensible implementation for the reasons described above - FTP credentials could be hidden from the user, and computation could be more performant server-side.

# EC2 FTP Server

As a first step, I wanted to create my own simple FTP server which I could use to develop and test against.
My first thought was to see if AWS offered a simple easy to user FTP server and found [AWS Transfer Family](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family/).
This seemed like a convenient option:

> Simple and seamless file transfer to Amazon S3 using SFTP, FTPS, and FTP

But at $0.30 per hour just to have the FTP endpoint enabled was about $216/month which was way too much.
There didn't seem to be any other good cheap or free FTP servers for such a project - just somewhere to throw a few megabytes of data and test reading the data from an FTP client.
EC2 seemed like a convenient and flexible way to go.

Check the EC2 [On-Demand Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) a t3a.nano is $0.0047 per Hour or less than $3.50/month.
After launching the instance the following links were helpful to connect:
[Connect to your Linux instance using an SSH client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) and [Get information about your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html#connection-prereqs-get-info-about-instance) which said:

> For Amazon Linux 2 or the Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`.

To connect via SSH with the downloaded key, the following command is used:

```sh
% ssh -i "/Users/dpwiese/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/programming/keys-and-security/dpwiese-aws-ec2-t2a-nano.pem" ec2-user@3.216.36.9
```

With a new EC2 instance created, I now needed to start an FTP server.

# Setting up FTP

The post [How to Configure FTP on AWS EC2](https://medium.com/tensult/configure-ftp-on-aws-ec2-85b5b56b9c94) was one of the first ones to show up in search, and had the few simple steps to follow to install and configure [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html).

```sh
# Edit vsftpd configuration
% sudo nano /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

# Restart vsftpd
% sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
```

Default directory when connecting contained a single subdirectory `pub` which is found using the following command:

```sh
# Find the folder: /var/ftp/pub
% find / -name pub
```

Having following the steps in the post above, the FTP server was ready to develop and test against.

# PHP Setup

Running [PHP's Built-in web server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) to serve locally

```sh
% php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
% php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 index.php
% php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t ./
```

Dependency management is handled with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
The first dependency that was installed was [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to store the FTP credentials in environment variables.
Available on [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/vlucas/phpdotenv).

```sh
# /usr/local/bin/composer
% which composer

# Install
% composer install
```

With minimal effort, `index.php` was served up locally, containing the code to connect to the FTP server, read and parse the data, and then pass it to JavaScript for plotting with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org).

Note in the code below the backtick for using multiline string, since when this example was first implemented `$bar` were the contents of a file, including newlines, which created an error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var foo = `<?php echo $bar; ?>`;
  console.log(foo);
</script>
```

This approach did work, using the [PHP FTP Extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ftp.php) and it's `ftp_fget()` function to read files from the FTP server, and functions like `str_getcsv()` to read and parse the CSV files, and downsample the contained data.
Plotting the data was straightforward in JavaScript.
However, using `microtime()` to measure the clock time for each call to `ftp_fget()` to download the file revealed about 500 ms to download the 600 kb file.
In this case there was a file generated every hour, and the past five days worth of data needed to be plotted, resulting in 120 files that needed to be downloaded and read.
At 500 ms each, this meant it would take about one minute to download them all.

Even with an order of magnitude increase in the download speed, it would still be too slow to use for its intended purpose.
The downloads could also potentially be parallelized.
The complexity required to do this and the limitations are not completely known to me, but regardless of how optimized this could be made, it's not a great approach to say the least to fetch 72 mb of data on each page load.

At this point there are two obvious alternatives to me.
1. Save the downloaded and parsed data to disk with something like `file_put_contents()` and use this local data for plotting.
This way, only which have not previously been downloaded need to, and the small local files can easily be read and plotted from.
This approach would require care to manage the local files and keep the local contents updated with the remote contents on the FTP, and if the processing and local saving was only triggered on page load, then the problem of having to fetch many files could still exist if there were no visitors to the page for some time.
Of course, that last problem could be easily solved by automating a visitor to the site to trigger this processing, but overall the solution is sounding terribly complex.
What should be a simple site to display some charts to a user now needs to perform FTP requests, and process and manage a bunch of data and files.
2. Create a worker that runs on a schedule to pull the latest files from the FTP, parse and downsample them, save the result to disk, and provide an API from which the PHP site can fetch the latest data.
Given this application need only quasi-realtime data, this seems like the most reasonable approach - run this processor every hour, and even if some operations take some time, it won't affect the user experience on the site.
